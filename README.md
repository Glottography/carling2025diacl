### Coverage

```geojson
{"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [[[-180.1, -55.8], [-180.1, 80.9], [180.1, 80.9], [180.1, -55.8], [-180.1, -55.8]]]}, "properties": {}}
```


### Focal year

Language polygons from the *DIACL/TITUS Polygon Archive* are annotated with a *timeframe*. The
majority of polygons lists "1750-2000" as associated timeframe, but there is some variation. In
all cases, though, 1750 lies within the given timeframe. Thus, the geographic features in this
Glottography dataset specify "1750" as "Year" in *ContributionTable* for each feature. This can
be taken as roughly equivalent to the annotation "traditional" in other Glottography datasets.
